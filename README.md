## About

Gothenburg Underground is a one-stop hub for Gothenburg's lesser known music venues, presenting a curated list of events across multiple venues.

At the moment this is application is just a proof of concept and only collects data from [Monument](https://www.monument031.com/calendar/). More venues will be added in the future as the application matures. When it's ready for production the idea is to make it available on a public domain. Stay tuned and bring your earplugs!
